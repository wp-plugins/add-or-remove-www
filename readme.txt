Add or Remove Www lets you easily configure your WordPress site to always (or never) use the www. subdomain in all links of the posts and pages.
== Description ==

Add or Remove Www seeks to solve a common problem: preventing redirects from a www- version to a non-www version of a site -- or vice-versa.

It's common that you'll create a content link or include an image, linking to http://YourSiteNameHereForExample.com/imageExample.jpg -- but your server then redirects that to http://www.YourSiteNameHereForExample.com/imageExample.jpg . That adds in an extra server request and delay to the user.

One solution is to go through every image and link, one by one, and make sure they're all consistent. Another solution is... to use our plugin.

We plan on adding more options to be edited -- if you have any other suggestions, please let us know! You can contact us via http://www.wpsos.io/wordpress-plugin-add-or-remove-www/

== Installation ==

The installation and use is very straightforward. You should:

1. Upload the folder `add-or-remove-www` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. From the 'Settings' menu, there should be a new option, called 'Add Or Remove Www'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which options do you modify? =

As of version 1.0, you can choose between two options: using the URLs with or without www.
Note: the version 1.0 does NOT change all the previously existing URLs, it affects all the content and image URLs that are saved/modified after saving the option.
